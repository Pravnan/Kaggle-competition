ðŸ“Š Hereâ€™s a Summary of What Your Plots Reveal:
Year Distribution & Boxplot:

Majority of vehicles are post-2010, peaking around 2015â€“2020.

There are older vehicles (outliers) before 2000â€”these could impact the model if not handled carefully.

Motor Volume Distribution & Boxplot:

Very tight concentration around 2.0 with a few rare outliers at very low or high values (e.g., 0.2, 4.0).

No strong visual correlation with price.

Price Distribution & Boxplot:

Highly skewed rightâ€”most prices cluster below $25,000 but some extreme outliers reach $87,000.

These high values are clear outliers and could distort the model.

Correlation Heatmap:

Only year and price show a moderate positive correlation (0.64).

Motor volume has no real correlation with price in this dataset.
